# CsvPetRegistrationData
A simple extensible solution for writing CSV data in C#

This uses reflection to get the property names and you can add more PetEntryModel properties as you like.
For example you may want to add a property for the pet name, or split out the first name and last name of the owner.

Uses NUnit and NSubstitute for unit testing
